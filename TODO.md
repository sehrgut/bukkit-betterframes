- ItemFrameBehaviours
- Configuration

##Initial Idea
- Right-click a frame on a chest to open the chest.
- Sneak-right-click for item rotation behaviour.
- Left-click on a frame does not break it.
- Item frame takes as long to break with any tool as a sign.
- Sneak-left-click on a frame to remove item.
